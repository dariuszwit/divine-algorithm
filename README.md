# God Class README

## Overview
The `God` class is a simple programmatic representation of a theological concept. It models the idea of belief in Jesus (the Son) as a requirement for obtaining eternal life. This program operates in a symbolic manner and is not meant for theological debates or doctrinal interpretations.

## Features
- **World Representation**: The class accepts a list of individuals, symbolizing the world.
- **Eternal Life Check**: Evaluates whether an individual believes in the Son (`Jesus`) and grants eternal life accordingly.

## Class: `God`

### Initialization
The class is instantiated with the following parameter:
- `world`: A list of people representing all individuals in the world.

```python
god = God(world)
```

### Attributes
- `world`: The list of people in the world.
- `son`: Always initialized as `"Jesus"`.

### Method: `eternal_life(person)`
Determines whether a person has eternal life. This is based on the `believes_in` method, which should be defined for each individual.

**Parameters**:
- `person`: The individual to be evaluated. This must have a `believes_in` method implemented.

**Returns**:
- `True`: If the person believes in Jesus.
- `False`: If the person does not believe in Jesus.

### Example Usage
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, belief):
        self.name = name
        self.belief = belief  # True if believes in Jesus, False otherwise

    def believes_in(self, son):
        return self.belief

# Define people in the world
world = [
    Person("Person1", True),  # Believes in Jesus
    Person("Person2", False)  # Does not believe in Jesus
]

# Instantiate the God class
god = God(world)

# Evaluate eternal life for each person
for person in world:
    if god.eternal_life(person):
        print(f"{person.name} has eternal life!")
    else:
        print(f"{person.name} will perish.")
```

**Output**:
```
Person1 has eternal life!
Person2 will perish.
```

## Notes
- The example requires a `Person` class with a `believes_in` method to simulate belief logic.
- This code is a symbolic representation and should be treated as a thought experiment rather than a theological tool.
